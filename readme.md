# r_mindsweeper

## USAGE
At the moment, this works in console by running minesweeper.py.

Initially, the randomly generated board will be printed, followed by a coordinate prompt.
Enter the coordinates, starting at 0, when prompted, and the selected tile will be
uncovered. If the tile is blank, the surrounding tiles will also be uncovered.

There is no way to flag tiles yet, but once the GUI is added that feature will be added.

## DESCRIPTION
**r_minesweeper** is a r/learnprogramming's attempt and creating it's own mindsweeper clone including a GUI and AI.


##Notes
If possible I think we should try use the Standard python library  as much as possible.
